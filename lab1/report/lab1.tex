\section{Introduction}

In 1797, British scientist Henry Cavendish became the first person to
successfully measure the gravitational interaction between two bodies in a
laboratory. The apparatus used by Cavendish consisted of a torsion balance
with two small lead spheres attached to either end, and two larger lead
spheres positioned on alternate sides of the horizontal arm of the balance.
By reflecting a light beam off of a mirror attached to the pendulum and
observing the change of position of the reflected beam on a distant
surface, Cavendish was able to observe a small difference in the
equilibrium position of the pendulum with the larger masses in place. Using
this method, Cavendish was successfully able to calculate Newton's
gravitational constant $G$ within $1\%$ of the currently accepted value. 

In this experiment, we replicate Cavendish's experiment using the
TEL-Atomic torsion pendulum that mimics the experimental setup used in
1797. The TEL-Atomic apparatus allows us to observe the oscillations of the
pendulum by way of an oscillating voltage readout on a computer. Using the
same technique as Cavendish did, we then calibrate the oscillations in
voltage to the pendulum's angle to determine the force between the pairs of
masses. Thus, using Newton's Law of Gravitation, we may calculate the value
of the gravitational constant $G$.

\section{Theory}

Consider a rod with two spherical masses of radius $r$ at each end.  The
rod has linear mass density $\sigma$ and length $L=2(d + r)$, where $d$ is
the distance from the center of the rod to each sphere. The two masses have
mass $m$. Two large tungsten masses, each with mass $M$ and radius $R$, are
placed near the smaller masses. The rod is allowed to rotate about its
center, which we will use as the origin, with the rod and all masses
existing in the $x$-$y$ plane. Each small spherical mass has moment of
inertia $I_\text{sphere} = 2mr^2/5 + md^2$, and the beam has moment of
inertia $I_\text{beam} = L\sigma(L^2 + w^2)/12$. Thus, the total moment
of inertia is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:moment_of_inertia}
    I = \frac{2}{5} m (2 r^2 + 5 d^2) + \frac{L\sigma}{12}(L^2 + w^2).
\end{equation}
We can then determine the equilibrium point by solving the following
equation:
\begin{equation}
    \sum_i \vec{\tau}_i = 0,
\end{equation}
where we sum over all of the torques acting on the system. 

Consider the system with only one of the tungsten spheres. Due to symmetry,
the other sphere will result in the same torque acting on the system, and
so we need only multiply by two at the end. Let $\vec{r} = d\x + b\y$ be the
position of the tungsten sphere. The two smaller spheres are at positions
$\vec{r}_1 = d \cos\theta\,\x + d \sin \theta \, \y$ and $\vec{r}_2 = -d
\cos \theta\,\x - d \sin \theta \, \y$. Thus, the separations between the
tungsten spheres and the smaller spheres are
\[
    \vec{R}_1 = \vec{r} - \vec{r}_1 = d(1 - \cos\theta)\x + (b -
    d\sin\theta) \y
\]
and
\[
    \vec{R}_2 = \vec{r} - \vec{r}_2 = d(1 + \cos\theta)\x + (b + d \sin
    \theta) \y.
\]
The forces acting on each small sphere are
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:forces}
    \vec{F}_k = \frac{G M m}{R_k^2}\,\uv{R}_k,
\end{equation}
where $k = 1$ or 2 depending on the sphere we look at. The corresponding
torques are therefore
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:torques}
    \vec{\tau}_k = \vec{r}_k \times \vec{F}_k.
\end{equation}

We now look to determine the torque acting on the rod itself. A small mass
element of the rod has mass $dm = \sigma\,dl$, where $dl$ is an
infinitesimal length. Choose a point $l$ on the rod, with $-d\leq l \leq
d$. Then the position of that point is $\vec{p} = l\cos\theta\,\x +
l\sin\theta\,\y$. The force acting on that particular point on the rod is
\[
    d\vec{F} = \frac{G M \sigma}{(\vec{r} - \vec{p})^2} \frac{\vec{r} -
    \vec{p}}{|\vec{r} - \vec{p}|} \, dl.
\]
We therefore find the torque to be
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:almost_rod_torque}
    \vec{\tau}_\text{rod} = \int \vec{p} \times d\vec{F}
    = G M \sigma \int_{-d}^d \frac{\vec{p}\times\vec{r}}{|\vec{r} -
    \vec{p}|^3} \, dl
\end{equation}
Expanding the terms, this integral is
\[
    G M \sigma \int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \frac{l (\uv{p} \times \vec{r}) }
{[l^2 - 2l (d \cos \theta + b \sin \theta) + b^2 + d^2]^{3/2}}\, dl.
\]
Let $\alpha = d \cos \theta + b \sin \theta$ and $\beta^2 = b^2 + d^2$.
For convenience, we will ignore the constant factors for now. 
We can rewrite the above as
\[
    \int_{-d}^{d} \frac{l\,dl}
    {[ (l - \alpha - \beta) (l - \alpha + \beta)]^{3/2}}.
\]
Using the substitution $u = l - \alpha$, this can be integrated to
find
\[
    \int \frac{u + \alpha}{(u^2 - \beta^2)^{3/2}}\,du
    = -\left.\frac{\alpha (l-\alpha) + \beta^2}
    {\beta^2 \sqrt{(l-\alpha)^2 - \beta^2}} \right|_{-L/2}^{L/2}.
\]
Thus, we have that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rod_torque}
    \vec{\tau}_\text{Rod} = - G M \sigma (\uv{p}\times\vec{r}) 
    \left.
    \frac{\alpha (l - \alpha) + \beta^2}
    {\beta^2 \sqrt{(l-\alpha)^2 - \beta^2}}
    \right|_{l=-L/2}^{l = L/2}.
\end{equation}

We finally consider the torque caused by the twisting of a thin tungsten
wire holding up the rod. Using a torsional pendulum as the model, we expect
the torque to have the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:torsional_pendulum}
    \vec{\tau}_\text{twist} = - \lambda (\theta - \theta_0) \,\z,
\end{equation}
where $\theta_0$ is the equilibrium angle of the rod when the two large
tungsten spheres are not present. The value of $\lambda$ must be determined
experimentally. 

The total torque is thus
\[
    \sum \vec{\tau}_i = 2(\vec{r}_1 \times \vec{F}_1 + \vec{r}_2 \times
    \vec{F}_2 + \tau_\text{rod}) + \tau_\text{twist} = 0.
\]
Solving for $G$ yields
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
    G = \frac{1}{2} \lambda (\theta - \theta_0)
    \times \left[
        Mm \left(\frac{1}{R_1^2} + \frac{1}{R_2^2}\right)
        - \frac{M \sigma}{\beta^2}
        |\uv{p} \times \vec{r}| 
        \left(
        \frac{\alpha  (2 \alpha +L)-2 \beta ^2}{\sqrt{(2 \alpha +L)^2-4
        \beta^2}}
        +\frac{\alpha  (L-2 \alpha ) + 2\beta^2}{\sqrt{(L-2 \alpha )^2-4
        \beta ^2}}
        \right)
    \right]^{-1}
    \label{eq:gravitational_constant}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}


\section{Data}

Using Mathematica we fit our data to a damped cosine wave to determine the displacement from equilibrium $\delta$, the angular frequency $\omega$, and the decay parameter $\beta$. The data sets and their fits are shown below.

Using the voltage data from the driven oscillations, we calibrate the device by comparing the maximal and minimal values of $V$ with the corresponding values of $\theta$ obtained by observing the change in the position of the reflected laser beam. The relation between these two variables is linear, given by $V = K \theta + \text{ const}$.

\section{Analysis}

To determine the gravitational force between the lead and tungsten spheres, we first must calculate the torsional constant $\lambda$ given by
$$
\lambda = I \left( \frac{2 \pi}{T} \right)^2.
$$
where $T$ is the (undamped) period of oscillation. The damped frequency $w_1$ is given by
$$
w_1 = \sqrt{w_0^2-\beta^2}
$$
where $w_0$ is the natural frequency and $\beta$ is the damping constant. Taking the mean of the fitting parameters obtained by our 5 data sets, we observe that $\omega_1 = 0.03221$ and $\beta = 0.001223$. Thus, 
$$
w_0 = \sqrt{w_1^2+\beta^2} = 0.03223
$$
and
$$
T = \frac{2\pi}{w_0} = 194.944.
$$
Using this value of the period and the moment of inertia calculated in section II, we observe that
$$
\lambda = 1.45722 \times 10^{-7} \text{ J}
$$
By Equation (??), we have that
$$
\tau_{\text{ext}} - \lambda(\theta - \theta_0) = 0
$$
